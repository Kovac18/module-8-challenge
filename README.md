  ## Tests
  Once you have ran 'npm run start' into your terminal (make sure you are in the src folder!), you may select a vehicle or create your own. There are 3 premade vehicles to use if you wish! After you have a vehicle you will be given many actions you can do with said vehicle such as starting it up, turning and even wheelies!
